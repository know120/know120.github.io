# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Notes Management feature will transform the current placeholder Notes page into a fully functional document management system similar to Notion or Microsoft Loop. Users will be able to create, edit, delete, and organize rich-text documents with various content types including text, code snippets, lists, and other structured content. The system will provide a seamless single-page experience for managing all types of documentation and notes.
