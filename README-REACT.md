# Portfolio - React Migration

This project has been migrated from Angular to React with JavaScript.

## Migration Summary

### What was migrated:
- ✅ Main portfolio dashboard with all sections (Home, About, Projects, Blog, Contact)

### Key Changes:
- **Framework**: Angular → React
- **Language**: TypeScript → JavaScript
- **Routing**: Angular Router → React Router DOM
- **Components**: Angular Components → React Functional Components
- **Styling**: PrimeNG Cards → Bootstrap Cards
